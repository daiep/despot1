This repository consists of Matlab codes for MRI T1 mapping based on the so-called DESPOT1 method, utilising variable flip angles with the same TR.

For more information and for using the codes, please cites:
"Rapid combined T1 and T2 mapping using gradient recalled acquisition in the steady state. Deoni et al. MRM 2003;49:515-526"

To test the code, please run "runme.m"
